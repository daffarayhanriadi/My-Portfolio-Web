Using image augmentation techniques, generates 500 additional image data on each dataset label, so the total dataset used is 2000 image data. The accuracy of the model used is 100% with an error of 0.0024. Using CNN architecture MobileNetV2 with transfer learning method. The techniques used in the transfer learning approach are freezing layer and hyperparameter.
